IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Turn on "HDR" on your Camera, Shaders requires it
- This VFX Asset looks much better in "Linear Rendering", but there is also optimized Prefabs for "Gamma Rendering" Mode
- Image Effects are necessary in order to make a great looking game, as well as our asset. Be sure you use "Tone Mapping" and "Bloom"
- We also recommend using Deferred Rendering for better performance
- If you using SRP, check the "Packages/SRP" folder, and unpack the right SRP into your project
- Check the GPU package, it's a package with updated shaders compatible with Particle GPU Mesh Instantiation. This technique will dramatically increase FPS in your projects.

HOW TO USE:

- First of all, check for Demo Scene in the Scenes folder. Also, there is a Prefabs folder with complete effects.
- Drag and Drop prefabs from the "Prefabs" folder into your scene, then assign your affector GameObject in the "Living Particle Controller" component.
- Assign multiple Affectors if you using an Array Prefab.
- If you want to use Ground Particles on a vertical surface, please check the XY UV and ZY UV properties of the material.

BASIC ADJUSTMENTS AND CUSTOMIZATION:

- You can scale, rotate and transform the prefab like you normally do.
- When you scale the effect, you might also need to scale the "Noise Tiling" and "Distance" parameters of the material
- Most of the adjustments come from Material parameters, not from Particle System.
- Materials have a lot of settings, just play with them and create your own unique look. Be aware, that in a play mode, most materials will be converted into instances. So if you change material settings in a play mode, the original material won't be affected. This is a great way to just test all the settings.
- Most of the parameters are described in a "02.MaterialParameters.txt" file.
