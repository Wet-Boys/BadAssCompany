BASIC MATERIAL PARAMETERS:

Final Texture - Emission mask, left this parameter empty to disable the mask
Final Color - Emission color of affected particles
Final Color 2 - Emission color of unaffected particles
Final Power - Final brightness of the image, you need to lower this value if you using "Gamma Rendering" Mode
Final Exp - When Ramp is disabled, this parameter controls the smoothness of the mask
Final Mask Multiply - Multiply result mask by this value

Ramp Enabled - Use ramp gradient to colorize particles
Ramp - Gradient texture, located in "VFXTextures" folder

Distance - Affected particles distance
Distance Power - Multiply distance mask by this value
Offset Power - Offsetting particle towards Affector

Camera Fade - Fade particles when near Camera
Close Fade - Fade particles when near Affector

Vertex Distortion - Distort vertices of particle mesh, suitable for paper or leafs effects

Ignore Y Axis - Ignore Y-Axis when calculating the mask
Affector Count - If you use more than one Affector, make sure that this value is the same as in the "Living Particle Array Controller" component

Noise, Noise 01 and Noise 02 - Noise textures for creating the final noise mask, you can play with this parameter freely and use your own noise textures
Noise Scroll Speed - Scroll/Panning speed of the texture
Noise Tiling - Tiling of the whole noise mask in world space coordinates, you need to adjust this value when scaling the effect
Noise Power - Power of the final noise mask
Noise Distortion - A texture used for distorting the noise
Noise Distortion Scroll Speed - Scroll/Panning speed of the texture
Noise Distortion Power - Amount of noise distortion


ARRAY MATERIALS:

If you planning to use more then one object to affect your particles, you need to use array shader variants. You can create an array variant from a regular prefab very easily.
Simply change the script from "LivingParticleController" to "LivingParticleArrayController", then assign all of your objects to it. And finally, change the
shader of a material to the one that has an "Array" in its name.


MORPH MATERIALS:

In version 1.2 the new morph shader was added. It uses morph textures to morph mesh particles. A couple of new properties was added to these shaders.
Most of the other properties remain the same.

Flip Morph/Emission/Offset Mask - Flips the values of the mask
Morph Main - Morph texture for vertex offset
Morph Normal - Morph normal texture for correct normals after using offset
Distance Remap - Remap the lower value of the distance map, use it to adjusting the distance mask
