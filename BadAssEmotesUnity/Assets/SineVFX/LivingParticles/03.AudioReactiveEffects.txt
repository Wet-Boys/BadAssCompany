Buffer Initial Decrease Speed - Speed at which particles will lose audio affection force
Buffer Decrease Speed Multiply - Speed will be multiplied by this value every frame
Freq Bands Power - Multiply the power of the spectrum
Audio Profile Initial Value - Initial maximum value for the spectrum, you can play with this parameter, it will affect how quickly the final spectrum result will smoothen out
Audio Profile Decreasing - Decrease the value above every frame by Audio Profile Decreasing Speed
Number Of Bands - chouse between 8 and 16 bands textures, 8x1 pixels or 16x1 pixels

AUDIO MODULE PARAMETERS:

UseBuffer - Particles now will slowly lose their affection power
FirstAndLastPixelBlack - Set the first and the last pixel of generated texture to black

NEW MATERIAL PARAMETERS:

Audio Spectrum - Controls the power of an initial spectrum texture
Audio Mask - Creates a radial mask
Audio Amplitude - Affects all particles based on an average amplitude parameter
