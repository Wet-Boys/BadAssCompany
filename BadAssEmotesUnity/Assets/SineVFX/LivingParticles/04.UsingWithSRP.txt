USING THIS ASSET WITH HDRP, LWPR or URP:

1. It is fairly simple, just unpack the right package from the "Packages/SRP" folder. After that, you can check the new Demo Scenes.
2. Also, the new SRP prefabs are added to your prefab folder as well.
3. HDRP shaders are fully editable with Shader Graph.
4. When using HDRP or URP, you don't need old PostProcessing, so you need to delete the "PostProcessingV2" folder to avoid errors.
